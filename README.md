This is a small library, still in development, to process kabyle verb endings. 
This is the process:


input: inflected form, for example: nekcem, beddleÎ³, etc 
first we need to determine the type of verb the form belongs to:
a. type lmed
b. type beddel
c. type cfu
...
To be able to identify the verb type, we need to analyse the inflections of the verb
starting with the 1st person singular inflections up to the 3rd personal plural
we do this for the aoriste form, then the preterit.
